I am <b>Vrushali Terekar</b> completed <b>Computer Engineering</b> from Sinhgad Institute of Technology & Science Pune. I'm currently doing <b>Full Stack Development</b>  but am also interested in and exploring other technology and frameworks after working in a fast-paced startup Dista Technology.

<h1 align="center">Tech-Stack</h1>

As a Developer at a product based startup I have a strong focus on Java, Spring Boot, and Angular, I specialize in building robust, high-performance web and enterprise applications. 
With hands-on experience in Java 8+, Spring Framework, I have successfully optimized backend systems and developed secure, scalable solutions using JWT, and RESTful services.
I have a deep understanding of OOP concepts and design patterns, and am experienced in working with both relational (BigQuery) and non-relational (Datastore) databases. 
I have developed and deployed microservices using Spring Boot framework, while leveraging GCP tools like App Engine and Cloud Run to optimize performance.
Beyond technical expertise, I excel in communication and collaboration. I actively engage with cross-functional teams to understand complex requirements and ensure the delivery of effective solutions. 
My ability to articulate technical concepts clearly and work closely with stakeholders has been key to successful project outcomes.
